# Bun: stack

## Primary task
Use this GLM kit to extract source facts for `Bun` without inventing endpoints, status codes, signatures, return shapes, or credentials.

## Input contract
- target_url: https://bun.com/reference/bun/WebAssembly/RuntimeError/stack

- approval_boundary: DO NOT POST EXTERNALLY UNTIL HUMAN APPROVAL.

## Expected output schema
```json
{"source_facts": [], "citations": [], "validation_status": "pending|validated|blocked"}
```

## Source facts needed
- Exact WebAssembly RuntimeError property names and types
- Exact stack trace method signatures and return types
- Exact error handling patterns and failure modes

## Safe command
```bash
python3 scripts/agentpress.py material-kit-validate agentpress/material-kits/bun-wasm-stack --json
```
