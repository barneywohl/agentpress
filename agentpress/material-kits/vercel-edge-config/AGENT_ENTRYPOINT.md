# Vercel: create an edge config

## Primary task
Use this GLM kit to extract source facts for `Vercel` without inventing endpoints, status codes, signatures, return shapes, or credentials.

## Input contract

- source_facts_needed: facts listed below must be checked against the source before external use.
- approval_boundary: DO NOT POST EXTERNALLY UNTIL HUMAN APPROVAL.

## Expected output schema
```json
{"source_facts": [], "citations": [], "validation_status": "pending|validated|blocked"}
```

## Source facts needed
- Exact API endpoint URL and HTTP method for creating an Edge Config
- Request body schema and required fields for the create request
- Authentication scope, project ID format, and required headers

## Safe command
```bash
python3 scripts/agentpress.py material-kit-validate agentpress/material-kits/vercel-edge-config --json
```
